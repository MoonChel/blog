When I travel, I usually pack my backpack with checklist in mind, but sometimes I forget something small, like a toothbrush because human's memory is not perfect. I thought, I can create a mobile app, that will help me to pack my things before travelling.   
I called it: Packie.

## MVP definition

1. Checklists overview - [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete "crud") functionality
2. Single item - [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete "crud")
3. Packing tips page

## Development

Before all UX proposals and coding, I need one last thing. It's [travel checklist](https://www.smartertravel.com/uploads/2019/05/The-Ultimate-Packing-List_Interactive-FINAL.pdf) itself, which will be used as default one for initiating main process.
