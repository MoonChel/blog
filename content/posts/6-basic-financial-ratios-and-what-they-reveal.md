## Working Capital Ratio

So, if XYZ Corp. has current assets of $8 million, and current liabilities of $4 million, that's a 2:1 ratio—pretty sound. But if two similar companies each had 2:1 ratios, but one had more cash among its current assets, that firm would be better able to pay off its debts quicker than the other.

## Quick Ratio

If XYZ has $8 million in current assets minus $2 million in inventories over $4 million in current liabilities, that's a 1.5:1 ratio. Companies like to have at least a 1:1 ratio here, but firms with less than that may be okay because it means they turn their inventories over quickly.

## Earnings Per Share – EPS

Earnings per share (EPS) is a company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding.

If XYZ has $7.6B of Net Income and preferred Dividends of $0 and weighted common shares as 3.98B, EPS will be equal to $7.6/3.98 = $1.91.

## Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

In essence, the price-to-earnings ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company in order to receive one dollar of that company’s earnings.

As a historical example, let's calculate the P/E ratio for Walmart Stores Inc. (WMT) as of November 14, 2017, when the company's stock price closed at $91.09. The company's profit for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017, was US$13.64 billion, and its number of shares outstanding was 3.1 billion. Its EPS can be calculated as $13.64 billion / 3.1 billion = $4.40. Walmart's P/E ratio is, therefore, $91.09 / $4.40 = 20.70x.

## Debt-Equity Ratio

The [debt-to-equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtequityratio.asp) (D/E) is calculated by adding outstanding long and short-term debt, and dividing it by the [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp) of shareholders' equity. 

Let's say XYZ has about $3.1 million worth of loans and had shareholders' equity of $13.3 million. That works out to a modest ratio of 0.23, which is acceptable under most circumstances. However, like all other ratios, the metric has to be analyzed in terms of industry norms and company-specific requirements.

### Book value

The book value of a company is the net difference between that company's total assets and total liabilities

## Return on Equity – ROE

ROE is expressed as a percentage and can be calculated for any company if net income and equity are both positive numbers. Net income is calculated before dividends paid to common shareholders and after dividends to preferred shareholders and interest to lenders.

So, let's assume companies A and B have net income of $50 millions and $100 millions and $250 millions of equity respectively. In this case ROE for A is 50 / 100 = 50% and ROE of B is 50 / 250 = 20%. This means that with lower equity from shareholders company A can produce more net income.
