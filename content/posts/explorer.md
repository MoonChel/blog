Everyone at least ones were in the situation, when you scrolling apps like foursquare or google maps straggling to pick 1 place to go there. It's so many of them, so you never sure if one you selected is the right one. This is called [paradox of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice "paradox of choice"). Don't forget that places are different in concepts.  
That's why I developed my own app, called: Explorer.
